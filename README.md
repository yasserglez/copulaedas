Platform for implementing and studying estimation of distribution
algorithms (EDAs) based on copulas. This package contains various EDAs
based on copulas and vines, and it also offers the possibility of
creating new algorithms. EDAs are implemented using S4 classes with
generic functions for its main parts: seeding, selection, learning,
sampling, replacement, local optimization, termination, and reporting.
The package also includes a group of well-known benchmark problems and
utility functions to study the behavior of EDAs.
