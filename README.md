Estimation of Distribution Algorithms Based on Copulas
------------------------------------------------------

Platform for implementing and studying estimation of distribution
algorithms (EDAs) based on copulas. This package contains complete
implementations of various EDAs based on copulas and vines, and it
also offers the possibility of creating new algorithms. EDAs are
implemented using S4 classes with generic functions for its main
parts: seeding, selection, learning, sampling, replacement, local
optimization, termination, and reporting. This package also includes a
group of well-known benchmark problems and utility functions to study
the behavior of EDAs.
