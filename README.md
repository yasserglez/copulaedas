[copulaedas](http://cran.r-project.org/package=copulaedas) provides a platform where
[EDAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_of_distribution_algorithm)
(estimation of distribution algorithms) based on
[copulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(probability_theory))
can be implemented and studied. The package offers complete
implementations of various EDAs based on copulas and vines, a group of
well-known optimization problems, and utility functions to study the
performance of the algorithms. Newly developed EDAs can be easily
integrated into the package by extending an S4 class with generic
functions for their main components.
