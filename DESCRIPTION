Description: Platform for implementing and studying estimation of
    distribution algorithms (EDAs) based on copulas. This package
    contains various EDAs based on copulas and vines, and it also
    offers the possibility of creating new algorithms. EDAs are
    implemented using S4 classes with generic functions for its main
    parts: seeding, selection, learning, sampling, replacement, local
    optimization, termination, and reporting. The package also
    includes a group of well-known benchmark problems and utility
    functions to study the behavior of EDAs.
