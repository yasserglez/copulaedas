Description: This package contains S4 classes and methods for the
    development of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). New 
    EDAs can be created specifying functions implementing its parts: 
    seeding, selection, learning, sampling, repairing, replacement, 
    local optimization, termination and reporting methods. The package also
    contains implementations of EDAs and functions for the analysis of the 
    results of EDAs. The package is based on the idea of the MATEDA toolbox 
    for MATLAB.
